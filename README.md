## Methodologies

### component-based development

Component-based software engineering (CBSE), also called as component-based development (CBD), is a branch of software engineering that emphasizes the separation of concerns with respect to the wide-ranging functionality available throughout a given software system.

### behavior driven development

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an Agile process designed to keep focus on stakeholder's value throughout the whole project. It is a way to do Test Driven Development (TDD) with clarity that can not be accomplished with Unit Testing. It is a way to describe and test functionality in (almost) natural language.

## Core

### React with Typescript

A JavaScript library for building declarative component-based user interfaces

### Data fetching

I made use of React Query and Axios for data fetching

## Styling

I made use of SASS for styling along with the 7-1 CSS Architecture and BEM class naming convention

## Absolute Import paths
